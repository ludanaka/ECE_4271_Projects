## ECE 4271: Applications of DSP

### Description
These are all my submitted projects for the course ECE 4271 during the semester Spring 2012.  This course covered several applications of using DSP theory by utilizing MATLAB and LabVIEW.  There were four projects total (two individual-based and two team-based)  The projects covered the following applications:

- Project 1: DTMF Signal Decoding
- Project 2: Binary Communication Transciever Design
- Project 3: Wireless DTMF Transciever Design Using USRP
- Project 4: AM Transciever Design Using USRP

Included in each project folder is the source code submitted and report detailing the aspects of the project implementation and results.
